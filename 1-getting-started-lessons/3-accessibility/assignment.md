# Analyze an inaccessible site

## Instructions

Identify a website that you believe is NOT accessible and create an action plan to improve its accessibility.
Your first task would be to identify this site, detail the ways in which you think it is inaccessible without using analytical tools, and then submit it to a Lighthouse analysis. Capture a pdf of the results of this analysis and outline a detailed plan with a minimum of ten points showing how the site could be improved.

## Table to test site accessibility

|----------|-----------|----------|----------------|
|          | missing <10% of what is required | missing 20% of what is required | missing 50% of what is required |

First Look: The interactive map relies on colors, as well as the view/hide buttons. Much of the information is in small text or too close together.
1st Audit: 41 Accessibility score on Lighthouse
Suggested changes:
Give images Alt names(especially socials logos that are links), use colorblind-friendly colors with high contrast for the map(and patterns if possible), increase spacing between layout.
