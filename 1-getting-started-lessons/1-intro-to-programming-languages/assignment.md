# Reading the Docs

## Instructions

There are many tools that a web developer may need that are on the [MDN documentation for client-side tooling](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Overview). Select 3 tools not covered in the lesson, explain why a web developer would use it, and search for a tool that falls under this category and share its documentation. Do not use the same tool example on MDN docs.

1. Source Code Control(Github): https://docs.github.com/
A developer uses source code control to be keep their code backed up online. This is beneficial to track changes and revert back if needed, to work from multiple devices, and to easily colloborate with other programmers.

2. Testing Tools(Jest): https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started
Testing code is important to developers to make sure it works as expected, as well as being the first line of defense against bugs by tessting the limits of our code and seeing where/how it breaks. This is especially iportant when code connects/relies on other code, whether it be yours or a colleague's. It can also double as documentation to uderstanding the code better.

3. Safety net(Docker): https://docs.docker.com/get-started
Safety nets, tools that ensure code is running correctly, is very important since machines are not perfect, and can run differently for different developers' machines or even differently on the servers we use. Tools like docker let us make perfect copies, to make sure it runs correctly everywhere and everytime. This is very benefical for coding collaboration as well.
